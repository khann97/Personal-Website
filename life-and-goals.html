            I set out to complete my Diploma in Computer Science and then continue to pursue 
            higher education and obtain a Degree in Computer Science. Eventually, work in the 
            IT industry, hopefully as a Solutions Artitech or even Database Administrator, 
            and of course work my way up. All in all, we'll see what the future has to offer 
            just have to put in the effort daily, every waking hour! Time Management is key.

            At a very young age I was surrounded by computer and was always a curious cat 
            about technology, how things work, what I can do with it, and so on. I keep a 
            "Goals" list and a To-Do List on my phone and I update the To-Do List daily, I 
            have to keep myself accountable and on track. After finishing my Education 
            and landing a Career, I plan to purchase a house and pay off my loans like 
            everyother person on this planet. But I want to also make sure my future is 
            secure, that I plan ahead. After all, the habits you have today will reflect 
            2, 5, 10+ years down the road. First, I have to take it day by day, become 
            proficient in what I do/want to do, perhaps get up to the level to start 
            doing some freelancing and hopefully internships.
