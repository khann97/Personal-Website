        <h2>TV Shows</h2>

        <p>
            Out of the several of TV Shows I've watched such as <em>"The Office"</em>, 
            <em>"Peaky Blinders"</em>, and <em>"Lyaly Al-Salheya"</em>, one of my all-time favourites is <em>"Friends"</em>. 
            I recently started watching it in mid 2021 and it keeps me wanting to watch 
            more. But as they say, everything in moderation, after all there are over 
            200+ epsiodes, and I don't want to finish it all quickly.
        <br>
        <br>
            You've probably heard of the <em>"Friends"</em> theme song, it's very iconic and 
            distinguishable. I highly doubt you haven't heard it, regardless give it a listen.

        <h2>Movies</h2>

        <p>
            I don' really watch movies that often, I feel its more of a group activity, but 
            if there is something I've been wanting to watch I will goto the theatres. 
            Otherwise, I like watching movies at the comform of my home, take breaks when 
            I need to, more freedom and a higher enjoyment factor in my opinion.
            I would say I'm more of a action and comedy kind of guy, those genres keep me 
            on the edge of my seat and continuously entertained, especially the 
            <em>James Bond</em> movies.
        </p>
        <p>There's a few movies that I keep up with and movies I can re-watch:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bond Films</li>
                <li>Avengers Films</li>
                <li>Rush Hour Films</li>
                <li>Tron: Legacy (2010)</li>
                <li>Catch Me If You Can (2002)</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Books</h2>

        </span>
        <p>It's not just tv shows and movies that are the only types of entertainment, it's 
            books! I read in my free time and consider that to be very productive and at 
            times, entertaining. I believe books make you grow more than you think. 
            Most people would likely not read but if you do something you don't like 
            you can end up tolerating it and eventually liking it, it's called 
            putting yourself in an uncomfortable zone.
        </p>
        <p>I highly recommend reading these books, give them a read:</p>
