            Hello, my name is Nader. I am Half Turkish and Half Indian, but 100% Human, not Alien. 
            The name <em>"Nader"</em> means "rare", "unique". It is also rare to find someone who 
            can pronounce it properly as several people usually mispronounce it, most likely 
            because the name is of Arabic origin. Nonetheless, I will teach you how to pronouce 
            it, try saying: <em>[ˈnaːdɪɾ]</em>
            <br>
            <br>
            If you are still not sure if you got the pronunciation right, try playing the audio
             clip below!

        <h2>Where am I from?</h2>
        <span>
            <img id="new-west-pic" src="images/new-west.png" alt="New Westminster">
        </span>
        <p>
            I was born and raised in New Westminster, BC. Nothing is more beautiful than British 
            Columbia, it is that simple! (except Istanbul, Turkey)
        </p>
        <p>
            My parents first went to London, United Kingdom, where my older brother was born, 
            after a few years, they came to Canada. That's when I came to this world and my 
        journey began. Throughout living in Canada and travelling to other places to visit, 
        there is nothing like home (Canada). Although, I highly recommend for you to consider 
        visiting Turkey, the views are absolutely stunning and breathtaking! In fact, the
         background you see is Cappadocia, Turkey, but pictures never to justice.

        </span>
        <p>Over the past years I have learned to do many interesting things, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Juggle blindfolded with:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bowling Pins</li>
                        <li>Tennis Balls</li>
                        <li>Frisbees</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Cut my own hair</li>
                <li>Solve a Rubik's Cube</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>How many languages do I know?</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>English</li>
                <li>Urdu</li>
                <li>Arabic</li>

                <li>JavaScript (November 2021)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I do need to brush up on some of my Arabic and Urdu as it is not the best, 
                but it is a work in progress. Also, many more programming languages to come!
