            What gets me excited every other week is race weekend. Some may think F1 isn't a 
            sport but trust these professional racing drivers are athletes. Their training is 
            intense as they have to make sure their bodies perform well and handle the extreme 
            conditions of the racetrack and the g-force of their cars. F1 Drivers usually 
            experience <strong>up to 6.5 g</strong> and peak speeds of 
            <strong>up to 372.5km/h</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The race schedule starts with Free Practice 1, 2, and 3, then a Qualifiying 
            Race, and finally followed by the Grand Prix.
        </p>
        <p> Here's a breakdown:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>FP1 (Friday)</li>
                <li>FP2 (Friday)</li>
                <li>FP3 (Saturday)</li>
                <li>Quali (Saturday)</li>
                <li>Race (Sunday)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            By far, the driver I follow and keep up to update with is <em>Charles Leclerc</em>
            , who drivers for <em>Scuderia Ferrari, #16</em> on the tarmac. Listen to the 
            sound of the F1 engine roar!

        <h2>Soccer</h2>

            At a very young age, I've always been fond of Soccer, I played with my dad all 
            the time, in elementary school, and highschool.. then life got busy. Although, 
            during summer we gather of bunch of our friends and play on the field, but not as 
            much as I would like unfortunately. Soccer involves a good amount of running and 
            therefore that became something I can do on my own and continue to be active. When 
            I'm not active, I'm watching <em>FIFA</em> or my team, <em>A.C. Milan</em> play. 
            Too bad that <em>Hakan Çalhanoğlu</em> a former Turkish footballer for 
            <em>A.C. Milan</em> left to join another team, but doesn't stop me from 
            supporting my team!
